To do the tasks, the rover with sensors mounted has to be taken to a testing site. The testing site 
had to be fed into the rover using user defined GPS coordinates which we called the waypoints. 

The testing site we chose was a parking lot with enough space for the rover to complete the 
autonomous mission.

Below is a picture of the rover on the testing site (the testing setup)
