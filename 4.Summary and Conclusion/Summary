  The rover played a very big role in solidfying our understanding of sensors and actuators! WE can confidently say we
have working knowlege of systems design with appropriate sensors and actuators, and  we can not only demonstrate good practice 
in data acquisition and measurement but also use this knowledge to optimize the system and sensor

 This mars rover task concludes the project designed for this class(sensors and actuators) and we could see that it was a build
up from the first part where we measured and analyzed the performance and characteristics of some sensors everyday sensors including dht,
ultrasonic etc (link attached in README.md)


In conclusion,
      With this project(s)/class we have been able to 
-Become exposed to various types of actuators motor
-Interface sensors and actuators with microcontroller
-Understand sensor metrics including range, sensitivity, accuracy, repeatability, and noise 
- Demonstrate knowledge of numerous sensor technologies and their applications !
