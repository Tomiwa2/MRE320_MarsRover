**TASK I**
      As mentioned in the README.md, the first part was all about using the rover with the additional
   sensors mounted to measure evnironmental data, extracting and analyzing the data gathered from the
   rover and sensor, comparing that data with the weather data gotten from the testing site and analyzing the
   gathered data to assess the sensors performance/characteristics while the rover was autonomously 
   navigating through preset the waypoint,(walk through of this in task 2)

      The end goal of this task was being able to improve the performnace of the sensor/rover using 
   data processing tools but there was also an extra task to implement the proposed data processing
   methods. 
 
        To properly get started with this task, we had to obtain the ground truth which served as an which
      we know from the previous project is an accurate and precise data and the best baseline for
      comparison!

**GROUND TRUTH** 
   In other to properly compare/calibrate and thus optimize the rover/sensor we needed the ground truth, 
thus using our knowledge from the first part of this course, we got the ground truth for altitude, 
temperature, pressure and humidity 

 Below are the ground truth gotten from the testing site(on the testing day)

**Temperature/Pressure and Humidity**
