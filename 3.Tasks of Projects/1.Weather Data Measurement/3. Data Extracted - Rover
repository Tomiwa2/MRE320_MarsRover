    The UAV log viewer also provided us a tool that enabled us extract the run plot as a csv and consequently
as an excel file! This way we could properly visualize the run using a computing software like excel(especially
because we could plot the data with a tool that is easily readable)

    Below are the data exrtracted from the rover which includes as we mentioned before, the temperature recorded
by the sensor and by the rover, that of the rover itself, the altitude recorded by the rover and the pressure 
recorded by the rover.
