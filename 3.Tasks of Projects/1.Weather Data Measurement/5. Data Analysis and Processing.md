Using excel allowed us visualize what we were working with and what needed to be done by allowing us plot graphs that showed
how the data we extarcted changed with time.

Below are graphs contaning the how the tempretaure of the sensor(DHT-11.temp) and rover(BARO.temp) changed with time


Graph of sensor temp vs time



Graph of rover temp vs time

The next graph just goes to solifify that the sensor was sufficient to buffer the rover and make us for its lack due to its humidity 
matching the groud trurh above it


Picture contaning ground truth of humidity taken at the testing side 


Graph of humidity chnage over time

The necxt graph shows the pressure which we need to optimize the altitude below it


Finally the las sets of graph shows exactly the rover needed to be optimized! graphs below contain plots of the altiude of the gps(which is very realiable) ansd that gotten from
the rover which we can see is not!
