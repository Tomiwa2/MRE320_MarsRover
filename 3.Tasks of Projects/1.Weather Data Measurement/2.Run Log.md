    Using the tools provided by one of the software mentioned earlier; the UAV log viewer,
we were able to extract and view the temperature measured by the rover’s sensor which we
then compared with the additional sensor and the ground truth.

   We had gotten the run data from the Navio as a BIN file, the UAV log viewer enabled us 
 extract some important weather related data below which we can see in the picture attached.
 
 •Onboard barometer, which include pressure sensor (BARO.Press) and temperature sensor
 (BARO.Temp).
•	Device Temperature sensor for the IMU sensors (IMU.T).
•	Altitude results gathered by GPS (GPS.Alt).

    The picture attached below is that of the run graph showing the weather data we mentioned aboveabove and some generated by the softwre

    The picture above shows a plot of the all the pressure, temperature and altitude vs time
data taken during the run: This includes the temp of the rover, and temp measured by the 
rover, temp measured by sensor, altitude of gps, altitude of the rover and pressure of rover 

   We chose these data because they the most important data that can best be use to access
   weather which is what we are after, we included the temperature of the rover itself in order
   to take any gain or lose into account!
   
  We then proceeded to extract the data into excel in order to properly visualize the data
  which can be seen in the next files after this!
