Recall, to get to our goal, we need to compare the sensor data with the rover and so we extracted the sensor data.
The arduino code saved the data as a csv file which can easily be plotted with excel! (One of the reasons why we did 
the same thing for the rover to have a uniform comparison method) 

    Below are the data exrtracted from the senor which includes as we mentioned before, the temperature recorded
by the sensor and the humidity recorded. Temperature ÂºC	 Humidity %

Note there the table does not have the time column even thought we had prepared for this. This is becuase the rover
cannot run more than one external sensor at the same time without an external system.
