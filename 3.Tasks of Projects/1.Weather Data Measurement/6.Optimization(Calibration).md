As we pointed in the previous files, there was a lot in the rover we had to make up for in the rover(now we
see why this was the endgoal of this task). Starting with temperature, we came up with the methods below to
try to optimize the rover by making up fro its measurements.

Below are attempts at doing so,

**Temperature**

     For temperature, doing a bit of research, we were able to find out one of the reasons why the temperature did not correlate ( as cited in Hickey, 2022 ) was probably due to heat/internal temperature which can cause the atmospheric temp displayed to be 15*c higher than actual

Taking that into consideration, we removed 15*c from the Baro.Temp and it correlated to some extent with
ground as you can see on the table below






**Pressure**

Not much needed to be done on pressure as comparing the ground truth to the Baro.Press, we had a % error of
about % 1.446


**Altitude**

For Altitude, we came up with two ways of optimizing, in the first, we noticed that the rover assumes starting
to be 0 ft, which means we must adjust it to local elevation and since the testing site which was Ralph Korte
Stadium's elevation was 443ft(135m), all we had to do was add that to all the values the sensor read which worked 
great as seen in the table below







The second way consisted of using the optimizied temperature, pressure and the formula below to calculate altitude

              
in which

Pb = static pressure (pressure at sea level)[Pa]

Tb= standard temperature (temperature at sea level) [K] 

Lb= standard temperature lapse rate [K/m] = -0.0065 [K/m]

h= height about sea level [m]

hb= height at the bottom of atmospheric layer [m]

R= universal gas constant = 8.31432 

g0= gravitational acceleration constant = 9.80665

M= molar mass of Earth’s air = 0.0289644 [kg/mol]
