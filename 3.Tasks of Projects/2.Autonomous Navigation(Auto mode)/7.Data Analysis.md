The data we extracted in the previous file was then plotted to better quantify the rover. Below are the graphs of the error and distance of paths
against time.

Graph of the distnace from the way points over time 



  Looking at the graphs above, we can see that the rover started initiallfar from the way points but started to get its baring over time! Thus we can
  saefly conclude that the rover can do autonomus mission given enough runs to det it on track!
