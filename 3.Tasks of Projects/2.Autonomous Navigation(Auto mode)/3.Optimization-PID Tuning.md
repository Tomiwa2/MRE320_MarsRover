   We have been mentioning PID tuning becuase it is the core of this task! Without it, the rover will never fulfil its intended purpose!
PID literally stands for P, proportional, I, integral, and D, derivative and it controlls all the rover's driving modes which
plays into how well the rover turns and how fast it completes the mission

   For the PID tuning configuration, the terrain of the chosen route was essential for the final output. 
As such, a parking lot was chosen. 

Below is a picture containing the values for the P, proportional, I, integral, and D, derivative which we worked with for
a while and obtained the path below

PID values we worked with for a while

Path it took after chaning it to the PID vales above 

Below is the PID value we changed it to to get the rover to cover the path as close as possible and in record time which 
it did! It finished the path in 15 mins! Thanks to the input of @RoboticsZ12!

 New Pid vales we changed it to followig improvemnts on the rover

And Below is the path it took after changing the PID  to the values above

    As previously stated, these values may differ depending on the testing site. At the end, we concluded that these value should be changed between
each run to make the most accurate and efficient waypoint mission.
