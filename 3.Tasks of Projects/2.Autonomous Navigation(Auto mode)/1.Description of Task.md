In this part, we were tasked with configuring the rover to conduct autonomous missions to designated GPS waypoints.
  This was how we were able to collect and analyze the data we used in the first part

During this planned mission, the Rover is given a set of user-defined GPS coordinates (i.e. the Waypoints). 
The Rover uses its current location and desired location to calculate the movement required to reach the desired location.

This was where a concept called PID came in (very handy) as it allowed the rover to successfuly finish the waypoints


 To complete this task, the rover had to travel the 16-point grid shown below as soon as possible, in a path as close to 
the planned path as possible, through PID tuning.

                                         Designed path for the rover to complete (in record time)

It is important to note that the distance between each neighborhood dot is 10 meters.

The rover/task was then graded on the following:

•	Total time it takes to complete the path.
•	Errors (distance) from the designed path, which can be found in the BIN files using UAV log viewer 
•	Distance from Waypoints, which can be found in NTUN.WpDist

Contained in the rest of the files are the data extracted from the run, the actual paths the rover took before and after
PID tuning
