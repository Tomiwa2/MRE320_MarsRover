The is basically the Raspberry Pi and Navio2 Configuration which are the heart and brain of the system. 
The avionics section consisted of downloading the software needed to communicate with the hardware

Notable among the softwares we used were,

-Mission Planner which is used to 
Connect to Navio2
Create the path for the rover to take called waypoint mission
Calibrate the remote control radio and compass
Tune the rover(PID)

-Putty to connect to the Raspberry Pi (Ardupilot)

-WinSCP and UAV Log Viewer to extract and analyze the performance of the rover

  The most notable part of this section was making sure the mission planner was properly set up as this was to be utilized 
  for PID (Proportional, integral and derivative system) tuning. PID affects the rover's driving modes and consequently 
  the waypoint and autonomous movement as such acquiring knowledge of PID was paramount to sucessfully completing the project

  Below are pictures showing different stages of the avionics setup,
