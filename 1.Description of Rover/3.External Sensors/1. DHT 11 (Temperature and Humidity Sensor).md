   The DHT-11 is a temperature and humidity sensor. It features a resistive-type humidity measurement component,
a NTC temperature measurement component and an 8-bit microcontroller. Its primary purpose is to measure temperature and 
humidity. 

    This sensor was attached so as to serve as a control for the data collected from the rover. We used the knowlege aqcuired 
   from the previous part of this project to extract data from the sensor which we then used to assess the performance/characteristics, 
   of the onboard sensor in comparison of the ground truth.

   Below is a picture the sensor and its wiring diagram
