The DS1307 is a real time module that keeps track of seconds, minutes, hours, days, dates, months,
and years. 

It was mounted to do just that as both the Navio 2 and DHT are time-agnostic. Although it did not quite serve this purpose, it is still worth mentioning as it is a very useful sensor

Below is a picture of the sensor and its wiring diagram
