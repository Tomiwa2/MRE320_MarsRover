**Hardware**
    
    The hardware part was made up of the rover body assembly and the electrical setup to connect the components togther.
Following the manual provided by @Brandonh291, we were able to put the rover togther as seen below.

  The Rover consists of various components including the wheels, suspension system, the frame.
The most imporant part of the hardware setup was undoubtebly sanding! This allowed the wheels and the 
suspension system to move freely without friction allowing for accurate motion of the rover

**Electronic Setup**

  The electrical setup allowed the components to communicate with each other but mostly played a major role into 
enabling the rover to be autonomous. This was where components like the radio, motor, its drivers, power module & switch,
GPS Antenna, Remote Control Reciever was installed. The biggest part of this section was the wiring which we made sure were 
well arranged as seen below
